# Skills & Work Samples

## Horseback Riding Camp Counselor

As a horseback riding camp counselor, I supervised and led daily activities for approximately twelve children, guiding them through both horsemanship and responsibility. I taught campers how to care for horses, practise stable safety, and develop basic riding skills, while also greeting families, outlining daily schedules, and organizing riding and grooming lessons. During lunch hours, I maintained the stables and ensured the horses' health by cleaning, bathing, and monitoring their comfort. Beyond the physical responsibilities, this role taught me how leadership and patience directly impact others' confidence. Watching campers grow comfortable around large animals reinforced the importance of clear instruction and trust, skills that will be essential in future roles involving teamwork, leadership, or education.

## Tutor for Kindergarten-Aged Children

Building on my interest in mentoring younger students, I worked as a tutor for kindergarten-aged children in a one-on-one learning environment. I supported early literacy by teaching the alphabet, beginner writing skills, and interactive songs that encouraged focus and cooperation. Each session included shared reading and phonics practice to help the child recognize words and sounds independently. This experience showed me how individualized support can significantly shape a child's confidence and academic growth. It also strengthened my communication skills and adaptability, reinforcing my interest in future pathways related to teaching, child development, or supportive learning environments.

## School Art Room Mural

In addition to leadership and teaching experiences, I collaborated with peers to design and paint a large mural for our school's art room. As a team, we developed a theme, created detailed sketches, and ensured the final design reflected creativity and school spirit. I contributed by scheduling painting sessions, mixing colours, outlining sections, and carefully painting over several weeks. This project emphasized the importance of collaboration, time management, and attention to detail in long-term creative work. Completing the mural and seeing its positive impact on the space strengthened my appreciation for visual communication and collaborative problem-solving, skills that are valuable in both creative and professional career pathways.
