# About Me

I am a university-bound student with the goal of pursuing a career in music. I demonstrate dependability, attentiveness, and perseverance in both individual and collaborative academic and musical settings. I am committed to continuous self-improvement, particularly in the area of verbal communication, and I actively challenge myself by participating in my community band, where clear coordination and professionalism are essential. Through these experiences, I continue to develop confidence in contributing within structured group environments. I value honesty and strive to approach my work with integrity, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility.
